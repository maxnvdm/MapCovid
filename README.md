This website is built upon the gatsby-starter-leaflet provided at https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet

The website is currently hosted at: https://covid-map-git-master.maxnvdm.vercel.app/

### Starting from Scratch

- Set up Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
- Install the Gatsby CLI globally:

```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

- Inside the directory of your choice, scaffold a new Gatsby site:

```
gatsby new my-map-app https://github.com/maxnvdm/MapCovid
```

For example, if I want my installation in `~/Code/new-gatsby-site`, I would navigate to `~/Code` and run:

```
gatsby new new-gatsby-site https://github.com/maxnvdm/MapCovid
```

- Navigate to your new directory and run:

```
yarn develop
```

- You should now be running a new Gatsby site locally! ðŸŽ‰
